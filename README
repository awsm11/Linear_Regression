This algorithm allows you to estimate your target data by using a model which provides a statistical relationship
between given data tables or arrays by reading from a file.
The target data you want to find out is a approximation of its exact result.

*** If you run the code without any changes ***
!! Essential !! : First of all, You need to download the excel file consisting of data table to run the code properly.
The algorithm contains specific data taken from an excel file as an example.
Thus you should enter the values in the excel table as input.
For instance;
Please enter the value you want to find out its result: "7500"
Please type the name of your input: "Total Premium"
Please type the name of target: "Sales"
Target Prediction: 130697.24070967002


The example usage of this algorithm takes a few seconds without changing any iteration counts.
If you increase iteration counts ( w and b ranges and spaces), the prediction will be more close to the its exact
solution.
However this approach could take more times depend on number of iterations.
More iteration means more time.

If model function does not make sense in terms of the data defined by you;
- The data may not be suitable for linear regression with one variable.
- Increasing the number of iterations might be solution of the problem.

The algorithm includes progress bar so you can follow process as the code is executed.
