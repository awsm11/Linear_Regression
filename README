This algorithm allows you to estimate your target data by using a model which provides a statistical relationship
between given data tables or arrays by reading from a file.
The target data you want to find out is an approximation of its exact result.
The code is representing the Linear Regression with one variable by using Gradient descent method.

***Problem Statement***
As the CEO of a restaurant franchise, you are exploring options for expanding your business by opening
new outlets in different cities. Your goal is to target cities that promise higher profitability.
You currently have data on the population and profits of your existing restaurants in various cities.
Additionally, you have information on the population of potential candidate cities where new outlets could be established.

*** Run the code ***
!! Essential !! : First of all, You need to download the excel file consisting of data table to run the code properly.
The algorithm contains specific data taken from an excel file as an example.
!! Essential !! : Secondly, You need to define the location of excel file where you have downloaded into pd.read_excel function 
as shown below. (this function is in the file "Reading_excel.py")
pd.read_excel(r'\file location\excel file name')
for instance:
excel_set = pd.read_excel(r'\Excel Data\data.xlsx')
Thirdly,
Thus you should enter the values in the excel table as an input.
For instance;
Please enter the population: "40000"
Profit Prediction: "10351"


The example usage of this algorithm takes a few seconds without changing any iteration counts.
If you increase iteration counts, the prediction will be more close to the its exact solution.
However this approach could take more times depend on number of iterations.
More iteration means more time.

*** To enter data sets manually ***
You can also create your specific data arrays manually and run the algorithm.
There is only one thing that you should do is to write your data arrays into x_axis and y_axis variables instead of excel data.
Code will be independent of the excel data automatically.
(x_axis and y_axis variables are exist in the file "Regression_algorithm.py")
for instance,
x_axis = np.array([123, 260, 303, 176, 188, 160, 196, 389, 252, 220])
y_axis = np.array([199, 499, 599, 252, 255, 242, 259, 573, 469, 475])


If model function does not make sense in terms of the data defined by you;
- The data may not be suitable for linear regression with one variable.
- Increasing the number of iterations might be solution of the problem.

The algorithm includes progress bar so you can follow process as the code is executed.
